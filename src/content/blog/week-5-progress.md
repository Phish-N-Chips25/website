## Week 5 Overview

This week marked an important milestone in our MEIA (Master's in Artificial Intelligence Engineering) journey at ISEP. We had two major deliverables: submitting our **preliminary knowledge report** (relatório prévio do conhecimento) and presenting a concise pitch to our classmates and professor.

## The Preliminary Knowledge Report

The preliminary knowledge report represents the culmination of our research efforts so far. This document synthesizes all the knowledge we've gathered about our cybersecurity-focused project, including:

- Background research on phishing detection techniques
- Current state-of-the-art approaches in the field
- Relevant literature review
- Initial understanding of AI methodologies applicable to our domain
- Preliminary project scope and objectives

Compiling this report helped us consolidate our understanding and identify gaps in our knowledge that we'll need to address moving forward.

## The 5-Minute Pitch

The pitch presentation was an exercise in clarity and conciseness. With just 5 minutes to communicate, we had to be strategic about what to cover:

### Our Presentation Structure

1. **Project Overview**: Brief introduction to our cybersecurity focus area
2. **Problem Statement**: Why phishing detection matters in today's digital landscape
3. **Current Knowledge Status**: What we've learned from our expert meetings and research
4. **Project Objectives**: What we aim to achieve with our AI solution

The time constraint was challenging but valuable - it forced us to distill our project to its essence and communicate only the most critical information.

## Insights from Other Teams

One of the most valuable aspects of this week was hearing from the other 9 teams. The diversity of projects in the first challenge is remarkable:

- Each team brought unique perspectives to their respective problem domains
- The range of AI applications showcased the versatility of artificial intelligence
- Several projects had particularly innovative approaches that sparked interesting discussions
- The interdisciplinary nature of MEIA really shone through in the variety of challenges being tackled

### What We Learned from Peers

Observing other presentations provided valuable insights:

- **Presentation techniques**: Different approaches to structuring a technical pitch
- **Scope management**: How other teams are defining their project boundaries
- **Methodology choices**: Various AI frameworks and approaches being considered
- **Challenge navigation**: Common obstacles and creative solutions

## Reflections and Moving Forward

### Key Takeaways

1. **Documentation is crucial**: The report-writing process helped clarify our thinking
2. **Brevity requires preparation**: A 5-minute pitch needs as much prep as a longer one
3. **Community learning**: We're not alone in this journey - peer insights are invaluable
4. **Iterative progress**: Each week builds on the last, gradually solidifying our project

### What's Next

With the preliminary knowledge report submitted and our pitch complete, we now move into the deeper implementation phase. Our focus for the coming weeks includes:

- Refining our project scope based on feedback received
- Beginning initial prototyping and experimentation
- Deepening our technical knowledge in specific areas identified during the report preparation
- Continuing to gather domain expertise from cybersecurity professionals

## Conclusion

Week 5 has been about consolidation and communication. We've transformed scattered research into structured knowledge and learned to articulate our vision concisely. The presentations from all 10 teams demonstrated the exciting potential of AI across diverse domains, and we're motivated to see where these projects - including our own - will lead.

The journey continues, and with each week, our project becomes more tangible and our path forward clearer.
