## Aligning on research priorities

This week the team set aside focused time to extend both the **State of the Art** review and our internal **Knowledge Base**. Working together in the library we mapped the most relevant academic papers, industry reports, and threat intelligence sources that will underpin the rest of the semester.

## Sharing progress in the round table

During the professors’ round table we summarized our progress so far and reiterated the project goal: demonstrate how AI techniques can reinforce cybersecurity defenses. The dialogue helped us confirm we are on the right track and highlighted a few angles to explore further, such as model robustness and incident response automation.

## Upcoming deliverables

We have two immediate deadlines:

- **State of the Art** submission due **12 October**.
- **Preliminary report and presentation** scheduled for **14 October**.

To stay ahead, we drafted an outline for both documents and identified the sections that need deeper references or practical examples.

## Splitting the workload

Everyone volunteered to lead a different portion of the research:

- Threat landscape overview
- Defensive AI techniques
- Governance and compliance considerations
- Case studies and implementation challenges

This division lets us move faster while still cross-reviewing each other’s work for consistency.

## Saturday online working session

We agreed to regroup online on **Saturday** to consolidate the document, resolve any open questions, and polish slides for the preliminary presentation. By closing the week with a collaborative sprint, we expect to enter the next deadlines with a cohesive narrative and an evidence-backed knowledge base.
